# Astarte message hub proto

This repository contains the `.proto` files used by the Astarte message hub as well as by any
client that wishes to connect itself to the message hub.

## Protobuf and gRPC versions

For each of the supported languages this repository contains also the compiled protobuf definitions
contained in the `.proto` files. In addition the gRPC services for those `.proto` files are also
generated.
Since different languages may use different gRPC implementations and protobuf compilers here is
a table with the used versions.

| Language | gRPC library                                 | gRPC library version | Protoc version |
|----------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Rust     | [tonic](https://docs.rs/tonic/latest/tonic/) | v0.11.0              | 29.3           |
| Python   | [grpc](https://github.com/grpc/grpc)         | v1.69.0              | 29.0           |
| C++      | [grpc](https://github.com/grpc/grpc)         | v1.69.0              | 29.0           |

```shell
make install
```

### Build language

Build and generate code for specific language.
```shell
make rust
```

### Install the generated code
